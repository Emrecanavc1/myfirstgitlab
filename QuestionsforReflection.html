1. Purpose of version control: To track changes in code, collaborate efficiently, and manage project history.

2. Git vs SVN/Mercurial: Git is distributed, allowing local commits and offline work, while SVN and Mercurial are centralized.

3. git add significance: It stages changes to be included in the next commit, providing control over what gets committed.

4. Handling multiple developers: Git uses branching and merging strategies to manage concurrent changes, and identifies merge conflicts when changes overlap.

5. Common merge conflicts: Occur when multiple developers edit the same line of code. Preventable through frequent pulls, clear communication, and feature branches.

6. git merge vs git rebase: Merge combines branches with a new commit, while rebase moves changes to the tip of another branch, keeping history linear.

7. Frequent commits: Helps track progress, isolate bugs, and improve collaboration.

8. Reverting a commit: Use git revert <commit_hash> to create a new commit that undoes changes, or git reset to move back in history (careful with this one).

9. Tracking history: Git uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to record snapshots and changes over time.

10. Creating branches: Isolates new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

11. Managing versions with tags: Use git tag <tag_name> to mark important milestones like releases.

12. Local vs remote repos: Local repositories are on your machine, while remote ones (like GitHub) are shared among team members.

13. Collaborating on platforms like GitHub: Involves cloning, branching, pull requests, and code reviews.

14. Handling large files with Git LFS: Stores large files separately and references them in the repository to improve performance.

15. Handling push errors: Check for authentication issues, conflicts, or branch tracking problems. Use git pull or git fetch to resolve conflicts before pushing.
